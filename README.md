Sony Clock Fix
==============

This is a simple Xposed module to fix the problem in Sony Clock app that no notification for upcoming alarm is displayed which allows the alarm to be dismissed. In fact I found that upcoming alarm notification is implemented in Sony Clock but due to maybe problem bug, it is not shown from time to time.

Installation instructions:
1. Install the module
2. Run Xposed Installer and enable the module Sony Clock Fix
3. Reboot the phone
